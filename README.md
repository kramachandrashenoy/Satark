# AI assisted distracted driver detection system

Objective: To design and implement a system that uses AI algorithms to detect distracted driving behaviours in real-time.

<b>Key Steps:</b>
Step 1: Data Collection
Step 2: Model Training and Fine-Tuning
Step 3: Real-Time Processing
Step 4: Front-End Development
Step 5: Backend Development
Step 6: Dashboard Development

<b>Takeaways</b>
We were able to train a Resnet neural network model sucessfully by gathering distracted driver dataset.
We used ultra-sonic sensors to detect any nearby objects and give an alert to the driver.
We were sucessful in fetching data from google APIs and recommend nearby hotels for the driver.
We were able to build a database to store numerical aspects of distracted drivers and analyse the data through pie-charts.
We tried exploring expandable AI and assist the drivers.
